--- This project contains a language service for Docker Compose.
---
--- `compose-language-service` can be installed via `npm`:
---
--- ```sh
--- npm install @microsoft/compose-language-service

--- Note: If the docker-compose-langserver doesn't startup when entering a `docker-compose.yaml` file, make sure that the filetype is `yaml.docker-compose`. You can set with: `:set filetype=yaml.docker-compose`.
vim.lsp.config("docker_compose_language_service", {
  cmd = { 'docker-compose-langserver', '--stdio' },
  filetypes = { 'yaml.docker-compose' },
  root_markers = { 'docker-compose.yaml', 'docker-compose.yml', 'compose.yaml', 'compose.yml' },
})
